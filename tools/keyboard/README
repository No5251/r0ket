How to sniff a Microsoft wireless keyboard with the r0ket

the "i just want to do it" version.

To sniff it, you need to know the MAC if the keyboard and the
channel(s) it sends on.  Typically it can send on 4 different channels
It always starts on the same channel when booted and changes if
there is RF interference.

-- Finding the keyboard

To find the channel/mac, run the key-scan.c0d l0dable.

It cycles through all 99 channels and will display possible
candidates. Make sure the keyboard transmits something continuously
to actually find it.

Easy mode is to unplug the dongle while doing this, as this will cause
the keyboard to transmit each key press for ~ 2sec on all 4 channels while
searching for the dongle.

If you want to be more covert, press down to disable auto-scan and
cycle through channels manually with right|left.

Once you have your channels found, press up to write them to the
dataflash as "KBD.MAC". - An example of this file can be found in
this directory.

-- Sniffing the keyboard

To sniff, run key-snif.c0d.

This requires a KBD.MAC file with channels/macs to listen to. Use
right|left to cycle through all the entries. It will display
key presses as soon as you find the correct/current channel/MAC.
Press up to enable writing scancodes to SNIFF.OUT in case you want
to capture the input. 

Use keyparse.pl in this directory to parse SNIFF.OUT after you got it
from the r0ket.

Pressing down toggles the debug modes and displays the sniffed packets
contents -- you probably don't need that.

-- Sending keys is not really working yet.

The poof of concept key-send.c0d currently allows you to send an "a"
after you remove and re-plug the dongle.
